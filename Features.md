# Loaner Application Feature - Usage Guide

This guide walks you through the new staff-created loaner application feature that mirrors the physical loan form process.

## üéØ Overview

The loaner application feature allows staff members to create loan applications on behalf of students and GSU team members. The system automatically handles user creation and matching based on the provided information.

## üë§ Who Can Use This Feature

- **Admin users**: Full access to create applications
- **Staff users**: Full access to create applications
- **Borrowers**: Cannot access this feature (they use self-service requests)

## üìã Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Access the Feature

1. Log in as an admin or staff member
2. Navigate to the **"Loaner Apps"** tab in the main navigation
3. Click **"Create Application"** button

### Step 2: Search for Existing Users (Optional)

Before creating a new application, you can search for existing users:

1. Use the **"Search Existing Users"** field
2. Type any part of:
   - Name (e.g., "John")
   - Email (e.g., "jdoe3@student.gsu.edu")
   - Panther ID (e.g., "002345678")
3. Select a user from the dropdown to auto-fill their information

### Step 3: Fill Borrower Information

Complete all required fields marked with asterisks (*):

#### **Name** *
- Full name of the borrower
- Example: `John Doe`

#### **Email Address** *
- Must follow GSU email formats:
  - Students: `name@student.gsu.edu`
  - GSU Team: `name@gsu.edu`
- Example: `jdoe3@student.gsu.edu`

#### **Panther ID** *
- GSU identification number
- Students typically: `002XXXXXX`
- Example: `002345678`

#### **Contact Phone** *
- Phone number for contact
- Example: `404-555-1001`

#### **User Type** *
- Select from dropdown:
  - **Student**: For enrolled students
  - **GSU Team**: For faculty, staff, and other GSU personnel

### Step 4: Select Equipment

1. Browse the available equipment grid
2. Check the boxes next to items you want to include
3. Each item shows:
   - Asset ID (e.g., `LAP001`)
   - RCB Sticker Number (e.g., `RCB001`)
   - Equipment type and details
   - Location information
   - Building restrictions (if any)

**Important Notes:**
- Multiple items can be selected for one application
- Items marked "Cannot leave building" have location restrictions
- Only available items are shown

### Step 5: Complete Loan Details

#### **Expected Return Date** *
- Use the date picker
- Must be a future date
- Consider academic calendar and loan policies

#### **Reason for Request** *
- Detailed explanation of why the equipment is needed
- Examples:
  - "Research project requirements"
  - "Remote learning setup"
  - "Presentation preparation"

#### **Borrower Signature** (Optional)
- Enter the borrower's full name as their signature
- This field can be completed later if needed

### Step 6: Submit the Application

1. Review all information for accuracy
2. Click **"Create Application"**
3. The system will:
   - Check if the user exists (by email AND Panther ID)
   - Create a new user if no match is found
   - Update existing user information if found
   - Create active loans for all selected items
   - Set item statuses to "loaned"
   - Record you as the approving staff member

## üîÑ User Matching Logic

The system uses intelligent user matching:

### **Exact Match Found**
- User exists with same email AND Panther ID
- Updates their name, phone, and user type
- Creates loans under existing user account

### **No Match Found**
- Creates a new user account
- Generates username from email prefix
- Sets role as "borrower"
- Creates loans under new user account

### **Important**: Both email AND Panther ID must match for existing user detection

## üìä What Happens After Submission

1. **Immediate Processing**:
   - Loans are created in "active" status
   - No approval needed (staff approval implied)
   - Equipment status updated to "loaned"

2. **User Account**:
   - New user can log in using email prefix as username
   - No password set initially (admin must set)
   - Account appears in user management

3. **Tracking**:
   - Loans marked as "staff_created" type
   - Your name recorded as approver
   - Application visible in loan management
